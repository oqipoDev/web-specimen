# **Web Specimen**

A _one-fits-all_ virtual specimen book

## In short

As self deprecating as the tag line is, I cannot for the life of me find a good tool to help me decide on a font to use. When it's ready, ideally, you can find typefaces by their actual features and get recommendations for look-alikes or successor types.

## But Why

If you want to look up a _geometric_ sans-serif with a high _x-Height_ that has more than just Latin characters you might have noticed that font providers don't trust you to know what you want, and only give you the choice between `serif`, `sans-serif`, `monospaced` and if they feel a bit spicy, `display`. Â¿Everything else? Just lump it in the `other` category. Why even bother.

So in the great developer tradition of "spending a week automating what would take you an hour", I'm spending way more than one week learning web Development to solve this problem. And hopefully you can get something from this as well (and contribute (no pressure)).
